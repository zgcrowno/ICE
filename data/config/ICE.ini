;TODO

;PLANS

;1. Enemies are capable of spawning at circuit's terminals which are closest to the ICE (Maybe only those that are actually touching the ICE?). If these enemies reach the opposite end of the circuit, the circuit is temporarily deactivated.
;2. The attacks that a boss performs are determined at least in part by the circuit that currently houses the player, or perhaps the circuits which are currently enabled. Maybe certain attacks are unavailable if certain circuits are unavailable, or maybe certain attacks are just modified slightly if certain circuits are unavailable.
;3. Circuits that terminate at the boss are closed (their terminals are visibly filled as opposed to open), meaning the player can't teleport from one terminal of those circuits to the other.
;4. Maybe the player has an ability similar to Street Fighter III's parries. If they press forward at JUST the right time, they take no damage from a projectile, and that projectile's destroyed.
;5. Maybe when a player projectile reaches a terminal that doesn't touch the ICE, instead of teleporting to the circuit's other terminal, it fires off in a spread-like fashion.
;6. Probably implement "broken circuits". These are circuits that, at some point along their length, are "cut" such that the player may only access one end by teleporting from the opposing terminal.
;7. Probably change player projectiles to function more like enemy projectiles, which is to say that they're not movers; they fire off in the direction the player is pointing (with the mouse or right stick), and are not bound to circuits.
